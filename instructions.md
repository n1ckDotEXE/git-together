# Git Together

The cohort that cheats together, sheets together.

---

### Setup

* one person will start a new repo on GitHub
* when they're done working, the other person will become a collaborator
* then the other person clones and starts working on it


### Introduction

We'll be improving our `git` cheat-sheeting, putting our best foot forward out of four possible feet--that is, you'll be working in pairs! We'll consolidate those pairs of cheat-sheets into one master cheat-sheet, adding some extra info, deciding on the best wording and format, and making it _pretty_.

Or, at least, as pretty as Markdown will allow.


### Goals

* Work on our collaboration skills.
* Get a bit more practice with Markdown.
* Get a LOT more practice with `git`.


### Setup

* Create a new repository on GitHub. Make sure to check the box to initialize the repo with a README!
* **Make your changes in README.md.** That way it will display right away on GH.
* Add your collaborator as an official collaborator. (In the Settings tab for the repository on GH's pages.)
* One of you will "drive" and one of you will "navigate", and you will switch at least once, halfway through (or more often than that if you want practice with `push` and `pull`).
* When you switch, run a `git push` (with an `add` and `commit` first, of course), then your partner will do a `git pull`.


### Guidelines

* Don't forget to research anything you don't know. You don't have to have this memorized! That's what research and cheatsheets are for!
* Work on the file one at a time, and switch which person is "driving" _at least_ once.
* Include as much information as you reasonably can on each `git` command.
* A poor collaborator is a poor developer, so... Don't Be A Jerk. Listen to your partner and find a plan you can both be proud of.


### git Commands You Should Cover

* git clone
* git status
* git log
* git add
* git commit
* git push


### What Could Make an Excellent Cheatsheet

* Feel free to talk about related topics. For example, you could use the `clone` section to talk about how forking works.
* Offer helpful tips. For instance, that it's a good idea to check your clone url to make sure you're not cloning an original repo when you meant to clone a forked version.
* Let people know when a command will work on more than one argument. Can you clone multiple repositories with one `git clone` command? How about add multiple files with `git add`? Can you do multiple commits with one `git commit`?
* Add any flags you know of!

Good luck!
